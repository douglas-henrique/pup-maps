# pup-maps

Simple project using puppeteer and readlineSync to search coordinates from a address in google maps. 
 
### Tech

Pup-maps uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Node JS] - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
* [puppeteer] - Library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome
* [readlineSync] - Synchronous Readline for interactively running to have a conversation with the user via a console(TTY).

This project is *only* for study. Don't use this on real server production. Use Google Maps API for real project.

### Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd pup-maps
$ npm install
$ node index.js
```
